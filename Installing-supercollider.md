NOTE: Please help keep this page up to date!  Feel free to update these instructions if you run into problems on a specific platform or with a certain install method.

### Binaries

Unless you need something particular from the bleeding edge, it's probably easiest to install pre-compiled binaries for your platform, which are available on the SuperCollider site here:

[http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/downloads/](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/downloads/)

### Checkout, build and install the latest Supercollider:

`git clone git://supercollider.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/supercollider/supercollider`

`cd supercollider`

`git submodule init`

`git submodule update`

`mkdir build`

`cd build`

`cmake ..`

If you don't have QT or don't want the QT gui you can turn it off like this: 

`cmake -DSC_QT=OFF ..`

Now compile and install:

`make`

`sudo make install`

### Checkout, build and install the latest SC3-Plugins:

`cd ..`

`git clone git://sc3-plugins.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/sc3-plugins/sc3-plugins`

`cd sc3-plugins`

`mkdir cmake_build`

`cd cmake_build`

Now you need to point cmake to your installed SuperCollider.  On Linux the standard install from source goes to /usr/local/include/SuperCollider/, but update it to wherever you installed it.

`cmake -DSC_PATH=/usr/local/include/SuperCollider/ ..`

`make`

`sudo make install`

`sudo ldconfig`

### Run supercollider

Listening on UDP port 2345:

`/usr/local/bin/scsynth -u 2345`
