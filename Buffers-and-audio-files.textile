You can load a wav file into an audio buffer using @(load-sample <path>)@:

```clj
(def flute-buf (load-sample "/home/rosejn/studio/samples/flutes/flutey-echo-intro-blast.wav"))
```

Buffers are in-memory storage spots for audio files, and they can be either read from disk or generated by synths.  You can view the contents of an audio buffer using the @(scope-buf <buffer>)@ function:

```clj
(scope :buf flute-buf)
```

While loading samples is nice, most of the time you'll want to load a sample and return a function that can be used to trigger the sample.  This can be done with @(sample <path>)@.

```clj
(def flute (sample "/home/rosejn/studio/samples/flutes/flutey-echo-intro-blast.wav"))

(flute)
```

If you want to load a sample and use it as a signal-generator in a more complex synth, then use @play-buf@ for example:

```clj
(def sample-buf (load-sample "36.wav"))
(defsynth reverb-on-left []
  (let [dry (play-buf 1 sample-buf)
	wet (free-verb dry 1)]
    (out 0 [wet dry])))

(reverb-on-left)
```
