The easiest way to get started with Overtone is to use "lein":http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen, so make sure you have it installed and working properly.  Then create a new project and add overtone to the dependency list:

```clj
(defproject tutorial "1.0"
  :dependencies [[overtone "0.1.2-SNAPSHOT"]])
```

Grab the dependencies, and then take it out for a spin.

```sh
$ lein deps
download stuff...

$ lein repl
```

```clj
> (use 'overtone.live)
> (boot)
> (hit)
> (hit)
```
